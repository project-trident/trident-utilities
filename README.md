### Description
This is a backend daemon for Void Linux systems which monitors udev events and generates XDG desktop shortcuts for removable devices within the "/media" directory. For browsing file-storage devices, *trident-automount* will automatically configure some *autofs* rules which allow these devices to be dynamically browsed via the "/browse/[devicename]" directories. The XDG shortcuts that trident-automount generates will automatically check/adjust the shortcuts based upon the type of device/filesystem.

The devices are mounted on the system by autofs **only while they are being used**. Trident-automount has the autofs mountpoints configured such that any device which is not used for 5 seconds will be automatically un-mounted, and can safely be detached from the system. If you wish to verify if a device is safe to remove, just run "mount" from the command line to ensure that the device is not included at the bottom of the list.

* Data CD (*cd9660* filesystem)
